            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Drums are percussion instruments that produce sound through the vibration of a stretched membrane, known as a drumhead, when struck with a drumstick, mallet, or hand. They play a crucial role in providing rhythm and groove in various styles of music, including rock, jazz, blues, and world music.</p>
