            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>A guitar is a stringed musical instrument that typically has six strings. It is played by strumming or plucking the strings with the fingers or a pick. Guitars are versatile instruments used in various styles of music, including rock, pop, jazz, blues, and classical.</p>

            <h2>Types of Guitars</h2>
            <p>There are several types of guitars, each with its own unique characteristics and sound:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Acoustic Guitar:</strong> Produces sound acoustically by transmitting the vibration of the strings to the air.</li>
                <li><strong>Electric Guitar:</strong> Requires an amplifier to produce sound and often has a solid body for reduced feedback and increased sustain.</li>
                <li><strong>Classical Guitar:</strong> Features nylon strings and is commonly used in classical and flamenco music.</li>
                <li><strong>Bass Guitar:</strong> Typically has four strings and is used primarily in rhythm and harmony sections of music.</li>
                <li><strong>Resonator Guitar:</strong> Produces sound through one or more metal cones rather than the traditional guitar soundboard.</li>
            </ul>
